# Welcome to EdgeNet!

EdgeNet is a distributed edge cloud, in the family of
[PlanetLab](https://planet-lab.org),
[GENI](https://geni.net),
[JGN-X](https://www.jgn.nict.go.jp/english/index.html),
and [PlanetLab Europe](https://www.planet-lab.eu/).
It is a modern distributed edge cloud, incorporating
advances in Cloud technologies over the past few years.

EdgeNet is based on *industry-standard Cloud software*, with
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as the containerization
technology and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) as the
node manager and deployment solution.  It is an *opt-in* global
Kubernetes cluster; once a user has authenticated with this portal and
been approved, she will be able to use standard Kubernetes tools and
technologies to deploy an application across the EdgeNet
infrastructure.
