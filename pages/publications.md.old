> The internet research community benefits from being able to deploy experimental software and conduct measurements from vantage points broadly scattered across the network. The currently widest-spread platform, RIPE Atlas, present in 6% of IPv4 and 9% of  IPv6 ASes, allows a few types of measurements from mostly resource-limited devices. PlanetLab offers general software deployment, but the US-based instance is gone, while PlanetLab Europe continues with just 36 nodes that offer a four-year-old Linux distribution on nodes that may be twice that age. The software-only Seattle testbed came closest to offering the community the ability to run both general code and measurements from a large number of vantage points. Can we draw lessons from experience going pack over twenty years (see table) to break through and finally put into production an internet-scale general-purpose fully measurement-capable platform? This white paper addresses two of the critical questions raised by the WOMBIR workshop: (1) "What infrastructure is needed for such \[internet measurement\] data?" (2) "How can we develop best practices to facilitate cooperation or collaboration with commercial service providers as we collect data?"

> EdgeNet is the prototype of a scalable, sustainable general-purpose testbed for very wide area distributed systems and extremely low-latency distributed services. In this, it is aimed at the same experimenters and systems that formed the core usage of previous, highly-successful wide-area testbeds such as PlanetLab [1], G-Lab [2], V-Node [5], GENI [4], and SAVI [3], and it incorporates many of the features that characterized those previous testbeds. EdgeNet's goal is to achieve the usability and research value of the previous generations of wide area testbed, whilst offering radical improvements in the scalability and sustainability of those systems. It achieves this scalability and sustainability through a strategy of using industry-standard open-source software as the basis of its software stack, and by a strategy of hardwarefree, bottom-up, site-driven deployment. EdgeNet follows the Seattle [6] and PlanetIgnite [9] strategy of permitting sites to join the testbed with purely local action.

> We describe the deployment of an Internet measurement experiment to three testbeds that offer Linux containers hosted at widely distributed vantage points: the well-established PlanetLab Central and PlanetLab Europe platforms, and the new EdgeNet platform. The experiment results were published in the proceedings of ACM IMC 2018. We compare the capabilities of each testbed and their effect on the ease of deployment of the experiment. Because the software for this experiment has several library dependencies and requires a recent compiler, it was easiest to deploy on EdgeNet, which is based on Docker and Kubernetes. This extended abstract is accompanied by a demonstration of the reproducible deployment of a measurement tool on EdgeNet.

> EdgeNet has been informed by the advances of cloud computing and the successes of such distributed systems as PlanetLab, GENI, G-Lab, SAVI, and V-Node: a large number of small points-of-presence, designed for the deployment of highly distributed experiments and applications. EdgeNet differs from its predecessors in two significant areas: first, it is a software-only infrastructure, where each worker node is designed to run part-or full-time on existing hardware at the local site; and, second, it uses modern, industry-standard software both as the node agent and the control framework. The first innovation permits rapid and unlimited scaling: whereas GENI and PlanetLab required the installation and maintenance of dedicated hardware at each site, EdgeNet requires only a software download, and a node can be added to the EdgeNet infrastructure in 15 minutes. The second offers performance, maintenance, and training benefits; rather than maintaining bespoke kernels and control frameworks, and developing training materials on using the latter, we are able to ride the wave of open-source and industry development, and the plethora of industry and community tutorial materials developed for industry standard control frameworks. The result is a global Kubernetes cluster, where pods of Docker containers form the service instances at each point of presence.
