## Create an account

We welcome bona fide researchers and instructors whose work will benefit from a global testbed that is
open to the Internet.
Its value lies in its distributed vantage points rather than in raw compute power.
Kindly review the [Acceptable Use Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/usage-policy.md %}) for more details.

To run experiments on EdgeNet, you need an account that you can obtain for free by signing up on
the [console application](https://console.edge-net.org/):

[Create an EdgeNet account](https://console.edge-net.org/registration){: .btn .btn-blue }

Please provide an institutional e-mail address.
EdgeNet administrators will verify the information that you provide and, once your account has been approved,
you will be able to create a new Team and manage users for your team.

You can also join an existing team, the administrators of that team will review and validate your access.

Finally you will be able to create a workspace and start to work on your project!

Team owners and administrators do _not_ need to be familiar with Docker or Kubernetes;
they can perform all authorizations via the web console,
and they can delegate authorization responsibility to a team member.

### Users at not-for-profit institutions

For researchers at not-for-profit institutions, including universities, research institutes, laboratories, and government,
EdgeNet administrators will verify a researcher's status, for instance by checking for their publications.

We welcome instructors who wish to use EdgeNet for laboratory exercises for their classes.
An instructor who is a team leader can authorize student accounts, for which they take responsibility.
Verification of your status might require e-mail exchange with <support@edge-net.org>.

If you are a student or intern, please ask your supervisor to register themselves, or to allow you to register them.
They can then authorize your account.

All users of a team's account free account share that team's limited quota.
That quota can be automatically increased if the team
[contributes nodes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/node-contribution.md %}) to EdgeNet, either from
their institutional premises, team members' homes, or from the cloud;
it takes no more than five minutes to do so.
Those unable to contribute nodes can ask <support@edge-net.org> to nonetheless consider a quota increase.

Even if your limited quota is sufficient, but you find that EdgeNet proves to be valuable to your research,
we do ask that you kindly support the platform through node contributions.

### Users at for-profit institutions

EdgeNet welcomes pre-commercial research conducted by individuals at for-profit institutions.
You may obtain a trial account with a limited quota for free.
Verification of your status might require e-mail exchange with <support@edge-net.org>.
Quota increases can be obtained as described above for not-for-profits.  
If EdgeNet proves to be valuable in your work, we ask that your institution kindly make a financial contribution to support the platform.
