## The EdgeNet Architecture

EdgeNet is implemented as a set of Kubernetes extensions based
on [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). The
EdgeNet source code is freely available on GitHub, and the EdgeNet architecture is described in several scientific
papers that are available via HAL.
