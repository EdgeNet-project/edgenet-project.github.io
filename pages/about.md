# About EdgeNet

EdgeNet, the globally distributed edge cloud for Internet researchers, is based on industry-standard 
Cloud software, using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for deployment and node management.
If you know how to deploy containers with Kubernetes, you know how to use EdgeNet; we welcome you to 
[register for a free account]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/running-experiments.md %}) today.
Anyone who wishes to do so may [contribute an EdgeNet node]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/node-contribution.md %}) 
-- it just takes five minutes -- and thereby support the not-for-profit research that is conducted on the platform.  

## The EdgeNet Team

EdgeNet is overseen by Rick McGeer, Timur Friedman, Olivier Fourmaux, and Justin Cappos, and is a 
joint project of [US Ignite](https://www.us-ignite.org), the [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/) lab
at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/),
the [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/),
the [Swarm Lab](https://swarmlab.berkeley.edu/home) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/),
the [Computer Science department](https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/computerscience/) at
the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/), 
the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/),
and [cslash/](https://cslash.com).

The lead developer is Berat Senel, and Maxime Mouchet and [Ciro Scognamiglio](https://cslash.com) are principal
members of the development team.

The EdgeNet control plane is operated by the [Dioptra](https://dioptra.io) group at Sorbonne University, 
which also runs [PlanetLab Europe](https://www.planet-lab.eu/).

## The EdgeNet Architecture

EdgeNet is implemented as a set of Kubernetes extensions based
on [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). The
EdgeNet source code is freely available on GitHub, and the EdgeNet architecture is described in several scientific
papers that are available via HAL.
