# EdgeNet Project Ideas

EdgeNet is a community-built system, and everyone is welcome to
contribute &mdash; both [new nodes](/contributing_nodes.md)
but also software that augments the EdgeNet core and provides
interesting functionality and services to all experimenters.

It's very likely that whatever your use case is, you are producing
solutions that are useful for other EdgeNet users too. We are happy
to feature your code via our GitHub organization,
[@EdgeNet-Project](https://github.com/EdgeNet-project/).

If you are looking for ideas to realize, or want to start a discussion
on an idea of yours, please take a look at our
[Ideation](https://github.com/orgs/EdgeNet-project/projects/1)
page on GitHub. (Read more about our project workflow
[here](https://github.com/EdgeNet-project/notes/blob/master/githubprojects.md).
