# Tutorial: Create a Set of EdgeNet Containers That You Can Access Via Remote Login
A main value proposition of EdgeNet is that it provides nodes that are
scattered across the internet, offering both topological and geographic
diversity. This tutorial focuses on the user whose workflow consists of
logging into containers and launching tools at the command line. An
archetypal user of this sort is a student in a computer networking course
who is carrying out lab exercises in network measurements. They want to conduct
pings and traceroutes from a variety of vantage points.

In this tutorial, you will create a Kubernetes pod that consists of a simple
container in which the `ping` and `traceroute` tools have been installed. You will
deploy replicas of the pod across EdgeNet. You will then be able to log into
these replicas and conduct pings and traceroutes.

## What You Will Do and What You Will Learn
You will create a vanilla CentOS container and install the `ping` and 
`traceroute` tools in it. You will deploy this container to EdgeNet nodes
around the world. You will then log in to one or more containers and
conduct measurements from the vantage points that they provide.

Following this tutorial, you will have the skills necessary to create
a Linux container, install the software that you like via a package
manager, and save the container as a Docker image for later deployment.
You will be able to deploy that image and log into instances of it
and use the software from each instance.

## Technologies That You Will Use
The technologies that you will use are:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), to create your container
2. [RPM] (https://rpm.org/), to install the software in the container 
3. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), to deploy the containers to the EdgeNet nodes

## Prepare
Create accounts:
1. EdgeNet (see [Using EdgeNet](https://edge-net.org/using_EdgeNet.html)),
  making a note of your namespace
2. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), a convenient place from which
  to pull Docker images onto your services

Install software:
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to launch Docker operations from
  the command line.
2. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
  to control a Kubernetes cluster from the command line

Download and test:
1. Download your config file from the portal (see [Using EdgeNet](https://edge-net.org/using_EdgeNet.html)
  and save a copy as `$HOME/.kube/config`. Create the `.kube` directory,
  which is where Kubernetes looks for a configuration file, if you do not
  already have one.
2. Run `$ kubectl get ns` to make sure that you're talking to the right cluster.


XXX

## Write and Test Your Server
This section assumes that we're using node.js as the server.  If you are
not using node.js, modify this section for the server that you're using.
We used the following code:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');
const port = 8080; // note: you should modify this because at the moment we haven't taken care of port contention
const handleRequest = function(request, response) {
  const parsedRequest = url.parse(request.url, true);
  
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end("Hello, World, from " + parsedRequest.query.hostname +"!\n");
}
var www = http.createServer(handleRequest);
www.listen(port);
```

Save the file in `server.js`.


_Warning!_  Use Javascript constructs with some care.  In particular,
don't use modern ECMAScript constructs such as '=>' for functions unless
you're prepared to control the node.js version in your Docker container.
See below.

Test the server by running

```bash 
$ node server.js
```

and then, in any browser, go to `http://localhost:8080/hello?hostname=foo`.
You should see `Hello, World, from foo!`.  You can also try 

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello?hostname=foo
``` 
and you should see the same thing.

_Note_: in the above, change 8080 to whatever random port you picked for
your server.

Kill the server and go on to the next step.

## Build, Test, and Push the Docker File
The next step is to containerize the *Hello, World* application, test it,
and push it to Docker Hub so it can be loaded.  In the same directory,
write the following markup:

```bash
FROM node:4.4
EXPOSE 8080
COPY server.js .
CMD node server.js
```

_Note_: in the above, change 8080 to whatever random port you picked for your server.  Save this into `dockerfile` (note: no extension) and run:

```bash
$ docker build -t  <username>/edgenet-helloworld .
```

where `<username>` is your Docker Hub user name.

Once the build has been successfully completed, we're ready to test.
On your local host, run:

```bash
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -d  <username>/edgenet-helloworld
```

As always, substitute the random port number you chose for 8080 in the
above.  Make sure the container is  running with `docker ps`.  You
should see something like:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
67b44219b1a4        geeproject/edgenet-helloworld   "/bin/sh -c 'node seâ€¦"   27 hours ago        Up 27 hours         0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   pensive_austin
```

If this is all working, repeat the test in your browser and/or with
`curl`.  When you see `Hello, World, from foo!`, kill the container with

```bash
$ docker stop 67b4
```

(substitute the first few digits of your container ID from the
`$ docker ps` command above).

Finally, push your container to Docker Hub.  Run:

```bash
$ docker push <username>/edgenet-helloworld
```

to push to Docker Hub.

## Deploy a Service on EdgeNet
Log in to the [EdgeNet head node](https://headnode.edge-net.org/)
following the directions in [Using EdgeNet](https://edge-net.org/using_EdgeNet.html).
Once you are logged in and have chosen your namespace, you should
see this screen:

![Create Button](assets/images/createButton.png)

Click the Create Button in the top right.  You should see this
screen:

![Create](assets/images/create.png)

Enter the following YAML code into the text box:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true           
      containers:
        - name: hello-world
          image: <username>/edgenet-helloworld
          ports:
          - containerPort: <your port>
            hostPort: <your port>
```

Where, as always, `<username>` is your Docker Hub username and `<your port>`
is the random port you've chosen.  Hit `Upload`.

The line `hostNetwork:true` tells Kubernetes to expose the ports from
the Pod.  A `ReplicaSet` is a number of Pods placed in the cluster; in
this case, we have chosen one, and since we didn't specify where this
should be placed it will be placed at a node chosen by Kubernetes.  You
should now see this:

![Deployed](assets/images/replica_set_deployed.png).

Supposing the node is `toronto.edge-net.io` as shown above, you can now
test with any browser by navigating to
`http://toronto.edge-net.io:<port-number>/hello?hostname=Toronto` or
with

```bash
$ curl http://toronto.edge-net.io:<port-number>/hello?hostname=Toronto
```

And get "Hello, World, from Toronto!"

Clicking on the links and menus will give you various views into your
ReplicaSet.  Play around with them and see what you can find out.  When
you're done, choose `Delete` from the right-hand menu in ReplicaSets.

![Delete](assets/images/delete.png)

It may take a few minutes to delete.

## A DaemonSet and Using `kubectl`
In this last section we're going to make `hello-world` run on _every_
node in EdgeNet.  And it's just as easy as it was to run on a single
node.

Once again, go to the EdgeNet dashboard and click the `Create` button in
the top right.  This time, when the wizard comes up, enter this YAML
code into the text box:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true           
      containers:
        - name: hello-world
          image: <username>/edgenet-helloworld
          ports:
          - containerPort: <your port>
            hostPort: <your port>
```

Notice that the change from our previous YAML is _one word_: DaemonSet
replaces ReplicaSet.  But this gives a dramatic change in result, as
we'll see.  Click `Upload`.  You will now see this:
![DaemonSet](assets/images/daemon_set.png).

_24 pods running, one on
every active EdgeNet node!_.  Of course, to test this we don't want to
manually type in every one, so we'll download the names of the nodes
using `kubectl`.

In a terminal window, type

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
```

You'll get an output like this:

```bash

```

`kubectl` is an extremely flexible and powerful tool to query and manage
your deployments and interaction with EdgeNet.  We can simply pipe this
into a file and do some editing, but fortunately `kubectl` will do a lot
of the work for us:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -o=custom-columns=node:.spec.nodeName
node
illinois.edge-net.io
ufl.edge-net.io
waynestate.edge-net.io
osf.edge-net.io
wv.edge-net.io
ucsd.edge-net.io
nysernet.edge-net.io
uh.edge-net.io
ohio.edge-net.io
indiana.edge-net.io
cenic.edge-net.io
toronto-core.edge-net.io
toronto.edge-net.io
louisiana.edge-net.io
iminds.edge-net.io
nps.edge-net.io
node-0
umich.edge-net.io
france.edge-net.io
clemson.edge-net.io
nyu.edge-net.io
northwestern.edge-net.io
hawaii.edge-net.io
```

Just the node names!  That's what we need.  Now let's put them in a file:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -o=custom-columns=node:.spec.nodeName  > data.py
```

Edit `data.py` to look like this:

```python
nodes = [
    'illinois.edge-net.io', 'ufl.edge-net.io', 'waynestate.edge-net.io', 'osf.edge-net.io', 'wv.edge-net.io', 'ucsd.edge-net.io', 'nysernet.edge-net.io', 'uh.edge-net.io', 'ohio.edge-net.io', 'indiana.edge-net.io', 'cenic.edge-net.io', 'toronto-core.edge-net.io', 'toronto.edge-net.io', 'louisiana.edge-net.io', 'iminds.edge-net.io', 'nps.edge-net.io', 'node-0', 'umich.edge-net.io', 'france.edge-net.io', 'clemson.edge-net.io', 'nyu.edge-net.io', 'northwestern.edge-net.io', 'hawaii.edge-net.io',
    ]
port = 8080
```

We can then use `data.py` with some reporting code.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python2.7
import urllib2
import sys
from data import nodes, port
import time

def get_response(node_tuple):
  try:
    query = node_tuple[0]
    return (query, node_tuple[1], urllib2.urlopen(query).read().rstrip())
  except urllib2.URLError:
    return (node_tuple[1], 'Error')


pairs = [(node, node.split('.')[0]) for node in nodes]


#
# build the queries
#
queries = [('http://%s:%d/hello?hostname=%s' % (pair[0], port, pair[1]), pair[0]) for pair in pairs]

#
# get the results and split into error and non-error
#

results = [get_response(query) for query in queries]
errors = [result for result in results if result[1] == 'Error']
results = [result for result in results if result[1] != 'Error']

#
# Print the unreachable nodes
#
if (len(errors) > 0): 
  print '| Unreachable |'
  print '|-------------|'
  for e in errors: print '|'  + e[0] + ' |'
if (len(results) > 0):
  # get   the times for each result, and set up records
  # for printing (node, greeting, time)
  final = []
  for r in results:
    start = time.time()
    get_response(r)
    end = time.time()
    final.append((r[1], r[2], (end - start) * 1000))
  #
  # print the results
  #
  
  print '| Node | Greeting | Time in ms |'
  print '|------|:--------:|-----------:|'
 
  for f in final:
    print '%s | %s | %d' % f

```

This will take awhile, and we may find that some nodes aren't as healthy
as we think.  Those are all the errors.  When the code runs, this is
what we see:


| Unreachable |
|-------------|
|toronto-core.edge-net.io |
|toronto.edge-net.io |
|node-0 |
|france.edge-net.io |
|clemson.edge-net.io |
