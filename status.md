# EdgeNet Status

As of June 2018, a first version of EdgeNet is available on the
public Internet. It currently spans about forty machines all around
the world.

We welcome your [contributions](/contributing_nodes.md)!

**TODO**: This page will show the live status of EdgeNet, including
a world map.

Before it does, please see the [EdgeNet Portal](https://sundewcluster.appspot.com/)
