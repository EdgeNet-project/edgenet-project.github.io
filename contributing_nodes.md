# Contributing nodes to EdgeNet

**TODO**: This page will describe how to contribute own nodes to EdgeNet.

The basic steps are

* Register your node at the portal
* Run the installation script
* Done.

This assumes you have a Ubuntu 16.04 box available to contribute.

**NOTE**: We have installation guides for some parts of the system
in our [Google docs](https://github.com/EdgeNet-project/notes/blob/master/googledocs.md).
Feel free to take a look as we update this page.
